Exercise 9.1
Show that table-lookup TD(lambda) is a special case of general TD(lambda) as given by equations (9.5-9.7).

Let w be a vector of length |S| and enumerate the states. Then, let v(S(i),w)=w(i). Thus, the general gradient-descent TD(lambda) equations become:
w_(t+1)=w_t+alpha*delta_t*z_t => v_(t+1)(S_i)=v_t(S_i)+alpha*delta_t*z_t
delta_t=R_(t+1)+gamma*v(S_(t+1),w_t)-v(S_t,w_t) => delta_t=R_(t+1)+gamma*v_t(S_(t+1))-v_t(S_t)
z_t=gamma*lambda*z_(t-1)+grad_(w_t)v(S_t,w_t) => z(S_i)_t=gamma*lambda*z(S_i)_(t-1) if S_i != S_t and z(S_t)_t=gamma*lambda*z(S_t)_(t-1)+1

Exercise 9.2
State aggregation is a simple form of generalizing function approximation in which states are grouped together, with one table entry (value estimate) used for each group. Whenever a state in a group is encountered, the group's entry is used to determine the state's value, and when the state is updated, the group's entry is updated. Show that this kind of state aggregation is a special case of a gradient method such as (9.4).

Let the number of groups be |G|, let w be a vector of length |G|, and let S(i) belong to group G(j). Then, let v(S(i),w)=w(j). The construction then proceeds similarly to the construction in Exercise 9.1.

Exercise 9.3
The equations given in this section are for the on-line version of gradient-descent TD(lambda). What are the equations for the off-line version? Give a complete description specifying the new weight vector at the end of an episode, w', in terms of the weight vector used during the episode, w. Start by modifying a forward-view equation for TD(lambda), such as (9.4).

w'=w+alpha*sum ((G_t^lambda-v(S_t,w)) grad_w v(S_t,w))

Exercise 9.4
For off-line updating, show that equations (9.5-9.7) produce updates identical to (9.4).



Exercise 9.5
How could we reproduce the tabular case within the linear framework?

Exercise 9.6
How could we reproduce the state aggregation case (see Exercise 8.4) within the linear framework?

See Exercise 9.2.

Exercise 9.7
Suppose we believe that one of two state dimensions is more likely to have an effect on the value function than is the other, that generalization should be primarily across this dimension rather than along it. What kind of tilings could be used to take advantage of this prior knowledge?

If this dimension is plotted along the x-axis, then a tiling with vertical stripes will
