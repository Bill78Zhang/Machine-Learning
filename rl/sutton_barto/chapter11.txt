Exercise 11.1
Design an on-policy method for undiscounted, continuing tasks.

Initialize R* and Q(s,a), for all s,a, arbitrarily
Repeat forever:
	S <- current state
	Choose action A in S using policy derived from Q (e.g., e-greedy)
	Take action A, observe R, S'
	Choose A' from S' using policy derived from Q (e.g., e-greedy)
	delta <- R+Q(S',A')-Q(S,A)-R*
	Q(S,A) <- Q(S,A)+alpha*delta
	R* <- R*+beta*delta
